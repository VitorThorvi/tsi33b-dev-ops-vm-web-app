# Roadmap

## Initial thoughts
As of 10th oct 2024, there is plenty of time to develop this project. It's not due until 11th nov, 2024.

The initial thought is to create or simply use an existent CRUD web app. Focusing on the assingment objective described as: **demonstrate its ability to work with web application virtualization.** .

Virtualization platform of choice is proxmox virtual enviroment. On a production enviroment such a simple crud app would be more resource efficient running as LXC. As a LXC it also would be more flexible to manage as CPU and memory usage could be managed without the need to restart the host. 
In this scenario, tough, it will be run as a full VM as it is a requirement for the assignment and the objective is not to be the most performant nor the most resilient CRUD app. It is, literally, to display ability to work with web app virtualization. **This context will be in mind during the whole development process.**

## Major tasks

- [ ] Create or find candidade CRUD web app;
- [ ] Run it locally. Solve major bugs on CRUD process;
- [ ] Verify if canditade web app satisfies evaluation criteria and its requirements;
- [ ] Develop topology map;
- [ ] Split the application to run on separate VM's;
- [ ] Record video showing the whole process in less than 12 minutes.

### 1 - Create or find candidade CRUD web app

The fictional company will be the Most Simple Company. From now on described as MSC. CRUD app will be the most simple CRUD, and will be named from now on as MSCRUD. 

It is not required to develop the application. But as a personal choise, I will initially develop the MSCRUD by myself, just as a personal challenge. If it takes more than 2 days to do it, I will then look for a built CRUD app and just implement it.

Also, initially the db of choice will be MySQL. Front end will also be the simplest front-end interface.
